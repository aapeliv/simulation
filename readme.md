# Recitations on Simulation using Python and Simpy

This [repo](https://github.com/aapeliv/simulation) contains recitations (hands-on lectures) on simulation. These were originally created for IEOR4404 *Simulation* at Columbia University in Fall 2021.

Some of these lectures do not make much sense without the accompanying recordings. Feel free to [contact me](https://www.aapelivuorinen.com) and I'll be happy to send you links to those recordings.

## Recitation 1: some sampling methods

* Accept-reject sampling
* Simple Monte-Carlo integration
* The Box-Muller method for sampling normal RVs

## Recitation 2: introduction to Python for Simulation

* Variables, flow control, data structures
* External libraries, numpy, matplotlib

## Recitation 3: diving into randomness

* 2D Monte Carlo integration
* Three ways to sample from Homogeneous Poisson processes

## Recitation 4: more Poisson processes and intro to queueing systems

* Sampling from 1D and 2D Poisson processes
* Simulating single-server queueing systems from scratch

## Recitation 5: non-homogeneous Poisson processes

* Sampling from non-homogeneous Poisson processes
* Revision for the mid-term exam

## Recitation 6: systems simulation with simpy

* Life sim

## Recitation 7: more systems simulation

* Simulation of a web app

## Recitation 8: antithetic systems simulation

* Simulating a caf√© with antithetic variance reduction

## Recitation 9: variance reduction

* When the antithetic method fails
* Contorl variates
* Importance sampling

## Recitation 10: hyperparameter optimization

* An example of hyperparameter optimization with `hyperopt`
